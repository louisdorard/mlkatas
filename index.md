# Machine Learning Katas

This website contains a series of challenges (*katas*) for practicing your Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills.

It was created to support the Machine Learning course taught at French engineering schools [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) and [IOGS](https://www.institutoptique.fr).

```{note}
Because this website is built with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), you can launch live Jupyter sessions in the cloud directly from any chapter. To do so, open a chapter, press the <i class="fas fa-rocket" title="rocket"></i> button in the toolbar above and select an online notebook service. You will be able to interact with the code and regenerate the chapter output.
```

This website is constantly evolving, with new content added regularly.
